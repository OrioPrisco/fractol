Possible optimizations :
	Find chunks whose points are always in the set, and mark them
	Maybe do the same for individual iterations ?
Possible upgrades:
	When zooming, only display camera's buffer once things settle down a little
		possibly make this togglable via a function key
	When zooming, display a streched version of the previous buffer while we calculate stuff
		could work really well if combined with previous point
	Add some post processing effect ?
		color_bounds could then be done in post processing for example
	Now that t_f_iterator is a typedef, can probably make a fractal struct
		without the norm losing its mind.
		that struct could contain info about what kind of optimizations work
		like boundary/chunk tracing or marching square.
