Possible optimizations :
	Find chunks whose points are always in the set, and mark them
	Maybe do the same for individual iterations ?
Possible upgrades:
	make draw only recolor the screen if camera->chunk is not null
		requires that other functions invalidate (free) the chunks in some circumenstances
	When zooming, only display camera's buffer once things settle down a little
		possibly make this togglable via a function key
	When zooming, display a streched version of the previous buffer while we calculate stuff
		could work really well if combined with previous point
	Add a pallette  pointer to the camera so pallettes can be switched
	Add some post processing effect ?
		color_bounds could then be done in post processing for example
TODO:
	Args parsing stuff
